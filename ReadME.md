# Activity_Recognition_Model

This Project is recognizing human behaviour in the wild, by using the data from smartphone and smartwatches. These devices are comman, which are close to human most of the time. 


## Dataset used for traning and Testing

For the training and testing purpose, the dataset 'The ExtraSensory Dataset' was used and is freely availabe on internet. It contains over 300,000 annotated samples from sixty users. From various sensors on the phone and watch has measured every minute as one example.
